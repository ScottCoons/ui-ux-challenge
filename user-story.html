        <p>Raymond Shepard</p>
    </div>
    <p>Ray Shepard has a lot of friends that share most of the same interests: Camping, hunting, fishing, shooting, good beer.  Something is missing, though.  Ray never liked the taste of coffee all that much, and when he's with his buddies on camping trips, or with his wife at breakfast, he can't share the American custom that is hot coffee. He feels like he's missing out.</p>
