            <span>Keith has a group of friends that share most of the same interests: Camping, hunting, fishing, shooting... premium coffee. That's where Keith stands apart from his posse. He never liked the taste of coffee, and when he's with his buddies on camping trips or with his family at breakfast, he can't share that age-old American custom. He feels like he's missing out. He feels weak.</span>
